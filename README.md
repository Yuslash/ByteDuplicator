2. 🛠️ **Requirements**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

3. ▶️ **Run the Script**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the script is located, and run the following command:


4. 📂 **Specify Source Directory**: You will be prompted to specify the source directory where the module files are located. Enter the full path to the directory containing the Python module files.

5. 📝 **Specify Destination File**: You will also be prompted to specify the destination file where you want to store the copied script. Enter the desired destination file name.

6. ⚙️ **Execution**: The script will then copy all Python module files from the specified source directory to the specified destination file.
